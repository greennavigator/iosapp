Green Navigator (iOS app)
=====================

Introduction
------------

"Green Navigator" is an iOS application that informs users about their entrance in a high polluted area. The app utilizes row data regarding air quality in specific areas of Attica region that are provided by the Ministry of Environment (at this time in row data files, in the future via a web service).

The areas that are observed by the Ministry are displayed on a map, within a circle of certain radius that is colored according to the pollution that has been recorded by ministry's station at this area. The following elements/compounds are being recorded: CO, SO2, NO2, O3, PM2,5 and their volume in the air determines the color of the circle in the map.

The main purpose of the application is to inform the user/driver of any vehicle for the high polluted areas, in a real time manner, and advice him to choose a different route in order not to pollute the area any further. This could consequently lead to air pollution reduction.

The application could prove exceptionally useful for: 

1) The vulnerable groups of people in order to provide them with information (especially, during summertime) regarding the areas with high risk air pollution rate.

2) The traffic police in order to control the flow of vehicles in major highways since they can determine areas of avoidance (either because of pollution, or because of traffic jams) and the users can be informed in real time to change their route.
